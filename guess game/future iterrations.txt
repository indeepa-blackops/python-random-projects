Next Steps and Further Enhancements (For more advanced learning):

Difficulty Levels: Allow the user to choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard),
    which would affect the range of numbers or the number of guesses.
High Scores: Store high scores in a file and display them to the user.
User Interface (GUI): Create a graphical user interface using a library like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy.
    This would be a significant step up in complexity but would make the game much more visually appealing.
